# spotify-and-python
A collection of spotify scripts that solved a few problems I had.

"copy_library_to_playlist.py" copies all of the songs in the "Liked Songs" part
of your library into a designated playlist. Currently Spotify does not offer an option
to share your liked songs with someone, only playlists. So I made this 
script to get around that.

"find_missing_tracks.py" saves a record of your library which can be cross referenced with your current songs to find if any are missing.  The "Like" button is next to the pause button on Spotify and I found myself accidently deleting things, sometimes without realizing/remembering the song name. This was especiallty common on runs and it could be tedius to go back and re-save the song in that moment.  This way I can find which songs it happened to for when I go to re-save them at a later time.
