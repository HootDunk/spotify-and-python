# spotify-and-python
A collection of spotify scripts that solved a few problems I had.
"copy_library_to_playlist.py" copies all of the songs in the "Liked Songs" part
of your library into a designated playlist. Currently Spotify does not offer an option
to share your liked songs with someone, only playlists. So I made this 
script to get around that.
