# spotify-and-python
# A collection of spotify scripts that solved a few problems I had
# copy_library_to_playlist.py copies the songs in the "Liked Songs" part
 of your library into a designated playlist. Currently there is now option
 to share your liked songs with someone, only playlists, so I made this 
script to get around that.
